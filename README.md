appkin
======

Simple web app for sharing events. Built using node.js and mongodb.

The world's first APP that turns your phone... into a NAPKIN!

In actuality, this is just a simple heroku app written in node.js and supported with mongodb. I wrote it while experimenting/playing around with a few new frameworks. The basic idea is that users can post or join events. Each event has a "threshold" minimum number of attendees. If that minimum is not met, the event will not occur. As of now, a work-in-progress version can be found at http://serene-brushlands-9854.herokuapp.com/
